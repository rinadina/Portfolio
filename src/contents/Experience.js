                <p>
                    Getting involved in my community has always been important to me; In high school my two friends and I launched a student newspaper club, one of my favorite memories from high school. I was also on the soccer team, I was part of the humanitarian club. While it may seem natural to get involved right in the first year of university, I only started being involved in my community in third year. Back in 2015 when I started university, I was a shy student, I focused more on my courses because I didn’t want to lag behind, and was not much for socializing.

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    But I always felt that I could do better, be better, and improve those things about myself, and hence, in 2017, I took my first step towards involving myself in the university culture, and through the volunteering positions that I chose, I was able to become a better version of myself. I am now more confident in my abilities to work with a team, to deal with conflict, to push and present concrete arguments when I believe in something, to communicate with people and public speaking.

                    Below is a detailed summary of each of my accomplishments as a university student, and the lessons I have learned from each one.

                <h2 id="name-title">2017 2018: IEEE SPAC 2018 Co-Lead</h2>

                <p>
                    IEEE  (pronounced Eye-triple-E) is short for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and holds multiple branches across the world. Amongst them 
                    include the IEEE Ottawa Section, which also governs the 3 student branches in Ottawa, including the <a id="aLink" href="https://ieeecarleton.ca/our-branch.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEEE Carleton University Student Branch.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The IEEE Carleton University student branch offers different services, including events, workshops and social activities for the student body. The branch is run by an executive team of volunteer students, elected yearly. The  Student Professional Awareness Conference (SPAC) is one of them, and is organized by the SPAC organizing team, a selected team of students, every year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was my first time volunteering for a student club in university, I was in my third year then and had gotten an email informing students of IEEE SPAC looking for volunteer organizers. I was always fond of event planning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, despite being nervous as it was my first time, I walked into the meeting, not knowing anyone, and was curious to learn more about the different organizer positions that were available. I wouldn’t say I had all the experience required to hold a leadership position on an event planning team at the time, I did have some, so I encouraged myself to give it a go. Out of the 13 open positions, I raised my hand for lead organizer and was selected. Looking back now, it was all very fast and I don’t think many people expected a random girl, who no one knew, to volunteer for a lead position. But I will always be grateful for the Chair at the time for giving me this opportunity. Years later I found out what the motivation was, which is to throw people in and see how they swim.

                <p id="name-title">
                Leading the 2018 SPAC team was a big change for me. I had to deal with coordinating tasks between my teammates, I had to deal with making decisions and taking responsibility, I was dealing with money, making sure my team was taking their jobs seriously and were completing tasks, helping them out when needed. By the end of those 5 months of planning and execution, whether I wanted to or not, I had learned how to take initiative and be a leader, I was more comfortable voicing my opinion, making decisions, delegating work, presenting and speaking to a crowd. It was a great time with highs and lows, but that is expected when you work on a project with people.

                <h2 id="name-title">2018-2019: IEEE Women In Engineering (WIE) Chair</h2>

                <p>
                    Following SPAC, which took place in January 2018, I found that I really enjoyed being at IEEE. The students there were so inspiring, and so friendly, I wanted to do more. So, I decided to run for one of the executive positions for the 2018-2019 school year. I chose the WIE Chair position because I felt that I could do more to encourage and contribute to the women in the engineering community at Carleton University. When I started university in 2015, I didn’t feel that there was a place or community to foster those relationships between the women in this field, and even at IEEE, it was rare to see a girl in the club.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    The WIE role was a roller coaster for sure. <a id="aLink" href="https://ieeecarleton.ca/wie.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEEE WIE at Carleton</a>, before I joined, had organized 1 event only for the past two years, a joint event with the IEEE WIE branch of the University of Ottawa called Wine and Cheese. Everyone referred to IEEE WIE as “Wine and Cheese”, because that was the only thing it was recognized for.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    So that year, I made it my goal to organize at least two events on top of Wine and Cheese, and I wanted one of them to be a tech panel featuring women in STEM. Because I felt like the girls needed to hear from women’s perspectives in this field, and would appreciate insight on their journey. I know I was curious about it.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    I had one person help me with everything related to IEEE WIE, the WIE Vice chair at the time. We were a team of two that were driving IEEE WIE, and there was no “WIE” budget, just a Wine and Cheese fund allocated, as that had been the only event organized for the last two years.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    So, I made a plan, set some goals; I wanted to grow the IEEE WIE community and WIE wasn’t prominent at school. So, we needed to market it, and for that we needed to host events that would make us stand out from the rest, and foster relationships with the engineering community. That school year, my teammate and I organized 5 events, raised the first profit for IEEE WIE in 2 years, gained social following, and attracted students, especially girls, in the engineering community to participate and join IEEE (and IEEE WIE) at Carleton.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    That year, starting in October 2018, we organized the first social event for IEEE WIE, and while we were expecting just six people, 20 joined us. I introduced a speed networking activity for students to get to know each other, had food and music, presented what our vision was for IEEE WIE, where to find us and how to join. After that, we presented at IEEE Day, we worked with the Women in Computer Science club to host the speed networking game at cuHacking. We had a lot of employers and students participate in the latter, and while we could only encourage 20 students in each of the two rounds we hosted, it was well received with the organizers and WIE was invited the following year at cuHacking to bring back this activity.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    The two biggest events hosted by us that year was the Speaker Series and IEEE WIE Wine and Cheese. The Speaker Series featured 4 women in the STEM industry, Software Engineer at Trend Micro, VP of Engineering at Flirtey, Technical Project Manager at QNX and Senior Software Engineer at Qlik. I came up with a timeline of tasks, reached out to potential guests, and even the department of engineering at Carleton for sponsorship, which they accepted. We received around 25 people for the event, which to be honest, considering that we were just starting out, was an accomplishment. The following year, IEEE WIE organized this event again in partnership with the Carleton Student Engineering Society, and received around 40 people.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    <a id="aLink" href="https://www.celebratewie.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEEE WIE Wine and Cheese</a> is a networking event organized by the University of Ottawa and Carleton University. The 10th Wine and Cheese was organized by 3 people, including me. It was held at the Orange Art Gallery, attended by 150 people, students and sponsors , and we raised a profit of $1.2k. I had different roles on the team, including webmaster and marketing lead. I also helped out with venue logistics and was one of the 3 co-hosts for the event. It was a big responsibility for just three people, but we got through it. I found that what was most effective and important for the team was constant communication, especially when the pressure got too high, or last minute mishaps occurred, like the microphone not working on D-Day, or juggling co-hosting and managing volunteers. Being on this team, and even as the WIE Chair, taught me how to deal with pressure and staying calm in crisis, coming up with solutions rapidly when things were time sensitive, being there when my team needed me, even if I was already busy with school and other IEEE WIE work.

                <p id="name-title">
                Overall, being the IEEE WIE Chair that year taught me valuable lessons for life. Like I mentioned above, I learned how to work under pressure, and that has been a great help for my internships. It’s also taught me to take initiative to do things or get things done even when odds aren’t in my favor; I remember there was a time when I needed a budget increase for WIE and was rejected, but I pushed, I made a spreadsheet explaining why we needed the money, where it was going, why it would be useful, and presented my case to the treasurer. I did get a budget increase haha. I learned how to think on my feet, especially as the lead. Most of all, being the WIE Chair taught me to take things as they come, expect the unexpected and prepare for the worst.

                <p id="name-title">
                    The year after that, as the elected IEEE Vice Chair, I saw the impact of my work, where more students joined in on the events, looked for upcoming ones, more girls started joining the club, and other student clubs wanted to work with us.

                <h2 id="name-title">2019-2020: IEEE Vice Chair</h2>

                <p>
                    I won an award that year in November 2019, the 2019 IEEE Canadian Foundation Scholarship, for my valued service and contribution to IEEE Carleton Student Branch. I was 1 of 5 recipients across Canada to receive this scholarship. I was proud, and grateful to the IEEE Carleton branch for nominating me first of all, and to the foundation for choosing me. This award was to be presented at the IEEE Ottawa Section Annual General Meeting (AGM) in November 2019, which was attended by 150 guests and volunteers from academia, government agencies, industry, and the student community.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    I’d attended past AGMs before, and one thing that always stood out to me were the co-hosts; they were students just like me, and hosting a big event, and I looked up to them. I wanted to challenge myself that year, and one of the areas I wanted to improve on was being at ease in the crowd, and talking to a crowd. So what better way to do that than co-hosting this event. I reached out to the person in charge of planning the 2019 IEEE Ottawa Section AGM, and explained why I was a good fit as a co-host for the event. I wasn’t the only student looking for this opportunity, but luckily enough I was picked. So, with my co-host, we met with the organizers, practiced our script a couple days in advance, and hosted the AGM. I had a lot of fun, and from the words of encouragement and praise I received that day, I’d say the crowd enjoyed it as well! But my biggest ‘omg I must be dreaming’ moment was when the IEEE Ottawa WIE Chair, Dr. Winnie Ye, came up to me and congratulated me personally on not only my award, but also for my performance as a co-host. I don’t think anything else will ever beat that.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    That same year, I was also elected as the Vice chair for the IEEE Carleton University Student branch. As WIE Chair the past year, I always had the support of the other executives on the team, and I wanted to give back and support the team just like they had for me. So, as the Vice Chair on a new executive team, I made sure I was there for them. I organized some events on my own, like IEEE Day and summer socials, consistently reached out to the execs to check on their progress, helped the Chair with managing the team, made schedule timelines and helped the team whenever needed.

                <h2 id="name-title">August 2020: Co-founder and Co-host of Capital Interns, Mentor at Technolgap</h2>

                <p>
                    My most recent contribution to my community is starting a podcast series, called <a id="aLink" href="https://linktr.ee/capitalinterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital Interns</a>, at the beginning of August 2020, with my friend. We have so far released 7 of 12 episodes, and will be recording our 10th one soon.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    This initiative was started with the goal of helping out high school students, or anyone, looking for insight and help in choosing their post secondary career paths. We’ve invited 12 post secondary students from different educational backgrounds to talk about their high school experiences, their personal takeaways and challenges through university, their internships and their future career goals.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    My motivation for joining this initiative is simple: When I was in highschool, there were not a lot of resources to help me gain insight on students’ experiences in university, tips on how to choose my program, how to deal with university. So, I wanted students to have a resource for that, a platform where students could talk to other students, share what they learned, give advice for others experiencing the same.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    Hence began the work to create the podcast series, which right now included content creation, co-hosting, meeting with guests, managing and meeting deadlines.
                </p>

                <br></br>

                <p>
                    Aside from that, I also discovered Technolgap this summer. It’s a community for women in post secondary programs related to technology, where we share our experiences and tips. I joined as a mentor, and I provide support to my mentee as a student in software engineering.
                </p>

                <p id="name-title">
                    My journey isn’t done, and I’m sure there will be more opportunities for helping others out, and improving myself. So for now, that is all!
